# Description
Flexbox series. Each commit will contain new feature. It is a self training of flexbox usage.

## 01 - Introduction
For practicing with flexbox, first, we need a CONTEINER within this container we put some ITEMS.
In the CSS of this class we will add `display:flex` to initialize the usage of FlexBox.
```
.container {
  display: flex;
  height: 100vh;
}
```
The `height: 100vh` will stretch the height of container 100% according to the viewport.
